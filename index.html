      <p>oh no.</p>
      <p>it’s decision time. </p>
      <p>what to do for a thesis topic.</p>
      <p>my brain is already spinning at the possibilities running around and bumping into each other in my little indecisive head.</p>
      <p>be practical and pick something that will look good in a portfolio / on a cv if i jump back into the non-profit world (in design of course).</p>
      <p>or do something more fun. pick something with typography or illustration or web design or ....</p>
      <p>just something where i won’t be researching depressing and / or infuriating and / or rage-inducing facts.</p>
      <p>ha, nope. ce n’est pas possible.</p>
      <p>as usual, the practical side wins out.</p>
      <p>buuuuut it is tapping into things i am very passionate about - ableism, empathy and disability advocacy.</p>
      <p>will it be fun? maybe not. well, parts of it will be.</p>
      <p>will i learn a lot? yes.</p>
      <p>could it maybe make a modicum of difference? maybe, i mean, probably not, but maybe.</p>
      <p>anything’s possible.</p>

      <p>of course i have preconceived notions of what i’ll find and what i’ll end up making for this whole thesis process. 
      <p>and of course within two days what i thought i would be doing has been turned around.</p> 
      <p>one week later, turned around again.</p> 
      <p>another week later, changed again.</p>
      <p>not ideal for someone with anxiety, but tis the nature of research. and i'm really grateful to learn.</p>
      <p>this general topic of ableism and empathy spoke to me because of the heightened marginalisation i’ve seen throughout this ongoing pandemic.</p> 
      <p>when those with disabilities spoke out about unsafe spaces when health protections dropped and they were told to just stay home permanently. told that their lives aren’t important enough. i wanted to do something.</p>
      <p>marginalisation and lack of access have always been an issue and progress has been made, but the west has taken a huge step back. economy over lives, of course.</p> 
      <p>the increased accessibility we finally figured out how to implement with the solutions we used in the early days abandoned and leaving inclusivity behind with it.</p>
      <p>i really didn’t think i would find that children show the most ableism. i thought it would be middle aged people, but middle aged people have been shown to have the lowest levels. huh.</p> 
      <p>i thought i would be doing a general education campaign, but that isn’t enough so I need to concentrate on the population that needs the most help to combat discrimination and ableism.</p> 
      <p>so what i saw in my head as an interactive campaign for adults has been adjusted to a digital and print curriculum piece for kids.</p> 
      <p>back to the research. hoping that this will be the final plan, but, as always, wanting to know more and wishing i could download all of the available information into my brain! that would be more efficient time-wise &#128522;</p>

      <p>ok.</p>
      <p>i kind of know what i’m going to do?</p>
      <p>i think?</p>
      <p>the projects on the way to the big proposal have definitely helped me to sit and take stock and make decisions.</p> 
      <p>i delay decisions as long as possible because there’s always more info i could take in, research i could find.</p> 
      <p>what if i’m wrong? what if my take on this would be so much better if i just researched for another hour?</p> 
      <p>the deadlines definitely help! even if i’ve been delayed on them for the past couple of weeks because of a family emergency.</p>
      <p>speaking of projects.</p> 
      <p>here’s what i have for my research posters.</p> 
    
      <img src="images/poster series mockup.png" alt="ableism poster series" width="700" vspace="20">
     
      <p>these are meant to show where you’re at and where you’re going in the process.</p> 
      <p>making these stressed me the heck out but organised my brain and the piles of research i’ve gathered. so, good stress.</p>
      <p>now that the brain has been rearranged on this and i know a little bit of what’s next, i am getting excited.</p> 
      <p>it’s a tough subject, but designing for kids is definitely better than my original plan to design for boomers. i’m looking forward to colours, graphics, and finding out how to communicate complicated stories and subjects to inspire empathy and change.</p>
